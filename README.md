# Forms

The goal of this project is to document common best practises for Oracle Forms development. It is meant to give you something to think about, with links to get more in-depth information about the subject. It is NOT meant to teach you Forms, Reports or PL/SQL.

Subfolders are:

/articles - Articles and Documents from the community can be stored here

/demos    - Demos for the Demo-Server (forms12c.de) 

/scripts  - Community-Scripts
